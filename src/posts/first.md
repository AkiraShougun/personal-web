# **First blog post**

\
This is my first blog post. I will be planning to do write more stuff in the future.
Hopefully I will upload the current stuff I'm working on in mathematics and share my opinions and everything.

Well uwu I can't just make you disappointed like this so I will give you an exercise to work on :3

\
Let $A(x) = \sum_{n \le x} a(n)$ where,

$$
a(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
0 &  \text{if }n\neq \text{a prime power} \\
\frac{1}{k} &  \text{if }n=p^k
\end{array} \right.
$$

Prove that,

$$
A(x) = \pi(x) + O(\sqrt{x} \log \log x)
$$

Have fun solving it nyaa :3
